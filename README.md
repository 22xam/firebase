    *   View available classes.
    *   Enroll in classes.
    *   View personal class schedule.
    *   Receive notifications (e.g., class reminders).
*   **Payment Integration:** Integration with a payment gateway for membership fees and class bookings.
*   **Push Notifications:** PWA functionality for push notifications (e.g., class updates, reminders).
*   **Offline Access:** Basic offline capabilities for viewing schedules and profiles.

## Technology Stack

*   **Frontend:** React
*   **Build Tool:** Vite
*   **Styling:** CSS Modules or styled-components (to be decided)

## Deliverables

*   Fully functional PWA with all required features implemented.
*   Clean and well-documented codebase.
*   Comprehensive README.md file.
*   Instructions for setup and deployment.
*   Basic test coverage for critical components.

## Additional Requirements

*   Responsive design for various screen sizes.
*   Adherence to PWA best practices.
*   Scalable architecture.
*   Consider accessibility guidelines.
*   User-friendly interface.

## Installation and Execution

1.  **Clone the repository:**
```
bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd gym-management-pwa
    
```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
```
bash
    npm install
    
```
3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add necessary environment variables (e.g., database connection string, API keys).

4.  **Start the development server:**
```
bash
    npm run dev
    
```
The application should be accessible at `http://localhost:5173/` (or the port specified by Vite).

5.  **Build for production:**
```
bash
    npm run build
    
```
This will generate a `dist` folder with the production build.

6.  **Serve the production build:**
    You can use a simple HTTP server like `serve`:
```
bash
    npm install -g serve
    serve -s dist
    
```
The production build will be served, and you can test the PWA features.
